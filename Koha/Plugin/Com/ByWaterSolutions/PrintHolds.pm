## Here we set our plugin version
our $VERSION = "{VERSION}";
our $MINIMUM_VERSION = "{MINIMUM_VERSION}";

## Here is our metadata, some keys are required, some are optional
our $metadata = {
    name            => 'Auto-Print Holds',
    author          => 'Kyle M Hall',
    date_authored   => '2009-01-27',
    date_updated    => "1900-01-01",
    minimum_version => $MINIMUM_VERSION,
    maximum_version => undef,
    version         => $VERSION,
    description     => 'Plugin to automatically print hold slips to printers as holds are placed',

## This is the minimum code required for a plugin's 'new' method
## More can be added, but none should be removed
sub new {
    my ( $class, $args ) = @_;

    ## We need to add our metadata here so our base class can access it
    $args->{'metadata'} = $metadata;
    $args->{'metadata'}->{'class'} = $class;

    ## Here, we call the 'new' method for our base class
    ## This runs some additional magic and checking
    ## and returns our actual $self
    my $self = $class->SUPER::new($args);

    return $self;
}

## The existance of a 'report' subroutine means the plugin is capable
## of running a report. This example report can output a list of patrons
## either as HTML or as a CSV file. Technically, you could put all your code
## in the report method, but that would be a really poor way to write code
## for all but the simplest reports
sub report {

    }

## The existance of a 'tool' subroutine means the plugin is capable
## of running a tool. The difference between a tool and a report is
## primarily semantic, but in general any plugin that modifies the
## Koha database should be considered a tool
sub tool {
    my ( $self, $args ) = @_;

}

## If your tool is complicated enough to needs it's own setting/configuration
## you will want to add a 'configure' method to your plugin like so.
## Here I am throwing all the logic into the 'configure' method, but it could
## be split up like the 'report' method is.
sub configure {
    my ( $self, $args ) = @_;

        $template->param(
            enable_opac_payments => $self->retrieve_data('enable_opac_payments'),
            foo             => $self->retrieve_data('foo'),
            bar             => $self->retrieve_data('bar'),
            last_upgraded   => $self->retrieve_data('last_upgraded'),

                enable_opac_payments => $cgi->param('enable_opac_payments'),
                foo                => $cgi->param('foo'),
                bar                => $cgi->param('bar'),
                last_configured_by => C4::Context->userenv->{'number'},

## This is the 'install' method. Any database tables or other setup that should
## be done when the plugin if first installed should be executed in this method.
## The installation method should always return true if the installation succeeded
## or false if it failed.
sub install() {
    my ( $self, $args ) = @_;

    my $table = $self->get_qualified_table_name('mytable');

## plugin is installed over an existing older version of a plugin
sub upgrade {
